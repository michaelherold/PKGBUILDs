# PKGBUILDs

A collection of Arch Linux PKGBUILDs I wrote and maintain on the
[Arch User Repository][aur] (AUR).

[aur]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?K=mherold&SeB=m

## Usage

Most of these packages should be installable with your favorite method
of interacting with the AUR. The package names match the names of the
folders in which they reside.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b my-new-feature``).
3. Commit your changes (``git commit -am 'Add some feature'``).
4. Push to the branch (``git push origin my-new-feature``).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
